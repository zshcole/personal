                <p>
                    my career goals have evolved significantly since i started in tech. initially, i thought 
                    working at a <strong>big tech company</strong> was the ultimate goal, but i've learned 
                    that impact and fulfillment matter more than prestige.
                </p>

                <p>
                    short-term, i want to <em>deepen my expertise in modern web technologies</em> and become 
                    a go-to person for complex frontend challenges. this means mastering advanced React patterns, 
                    exploring <span style="text-decoration: underline;">emerging frameworks</span>, and 
                    understanding how to build truly scalable applications.
                </p>

                <hr class="divider">

                <p>
                    medium-term goals focus on <mark>technical leadership and mentorship</mark>. i want to 
                    lead teams that build products people actually love using. this involves not just writing 
                    good code, but also helping other developers grow and creating engineering cultures that 
                    prioritize both quality and speed.
                </p>

                <p>
                    i'm particularly interested in the intersection of <strong>e-commerce and developer experience</strong>. 
                    platforms like Shopify and Salesforce Commerce Cloud are transforming how businesses operate 
                    online, and i want to be part of building the next generation of these tools.
                </p>

                <p>
                    long-term, i see myself in one of two paths:
                </p>

                <p>
                    • becoming a <em>principal engineer</em> at a company building developer tools or platforms<br>
                    • starting my own company focused on making web development more accessible and enjoyable<br>
                    • contributing to open source projects that have meaningful impact on the developer community
                </p>

                <hr class="divider">

                <p>
                    what drives me is the belief that <span style="font-weight: bold;">good software can make 
                    people's lives significantly better</span>. whether that's helping a small business owner 
                    set up their first online store or building tools that let developers ship features faster, 
                    i want my work to have tangible positive impact.
                </p>

                <p>
                    i'm also committed to <mark>continuous learning</mark>. the tech landscape changes rapidly, 
                    and staying current requires constant curiosity and adaptation. i want to maintain that 
                    beginner's mindset throughout my career, always looking for better ways to solve problems.
                </p>

                <p>
                    ultimately, success for me means building things that last, working with people i respect, 
                    and knowing that my contributions made someone's day a little bit easier.
