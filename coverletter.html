                <p>
                    dear hiring manager,
                </p>

                <p>
                    i'm writing to express my interest in joining your development team. my background in 
                    <strong>full-stack development</strong> and experience with modern web technologies makes me 
                    a strong candidate for this position.
                </p>

                <p>
                    after working in big-tech for a while, i realized that my <em>passion lies in building 
                    meaningful products</em> rather than just maintaining existing systems. this led me to 
                    focus on personal projects and eventually pursue opportunities where i can make a real impact.
                </p>

                <hr class="divider">

                <p>
                    throughout my career, i've developed expertise in <span style="text-decoration: underline;">JavaScript, 
                    TypeScript, and React</span>, with particular experience in e-commerce platforms and headless 
                    commerce solutions. my recent work with <mark>Salesforce Commerce Cloud and PWAKit</mark> and downstream
                    systems has given me deep insights into scalable web applications.
                </p>

                <p>
                    what sets me apart is my ability to <strong>bridge the gap between technical implementation 
                    and user experience</strong>. i don't just write code - i think about how users will interact 
                    with the products i build and how to make those interactions as smooth as possible.
                </p>

                <p>
                    some highlights from my recent work include:
                </p>

                <p>
                    • contributed to the enhancement of <mark>BOPIS</mark> capabilities, resulting in <em>40% omnichannel conversions</em><br>
                    • reducing page load times by 30% through performance optimization<br>
                    • building e-commerce platforms processing over <mark>$2M in monthly transactions</mark><br>
                    • implementing custom SCAPI integrations for enterprise clients
                </p>

                <hr class="divider">

                <p>
                    i'm particularly drawn to your company because of your commitment to innovation and 
                    building products that actually solve real problems. this aligns perfectly with my own 
                    philosophy of <span style="font-weight: bold;">creating technology that makes people's lives better</span>.
                </p>

                <p>
                    i'd love the opportunity to discuss how my experience and passion for development can 
                    contribute to your team's success. thank you for considering my application.
                </p>

                <p>
                    best regards,<br>
