                    <p>
                        When I first started working on e-commerce platforms, I was overwhelmed by the complexity. 
                        Customer orders, inventory management, payment processing, shipping methods, and downstream systems – it felt like 
                        trying to solve a dozen different problems at once. That's when I discovered domain-driven design (DDD), 
                        and it changed how I approach building software.
                    </p>

                    <h2>What is Domain-Driven Design?</h2>
                    
                    <p>
                        Domain-driven design is about modeling your software around the business domain first, 
                        then letting the technical implementation follow. Instead of starting with databases and APIs, 
                        you start by understanding the business problems you're solving.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        In e-commerce, this means understanding concepts like:
                    </p>

                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Orders</strong> – not just database records, but business processes with states and rules</li>
                        <li><strong>Inventory</strong> – availability, reservations, and allocation strategies</li>
                        <li><strong>Customers</strong> – preferences, purchase history, and lifecycle management</li>
                        <li><strong>Products</strong> – variants, bundles, and complex pricing rules</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h2>Why DDD Matters for E-commerce</h2>

                    <p>
                        E-commerce platforms are inherently complex because they mirror real-world business operations. 
                        Without a clear domain model, you end up with:
                    </p>

                    <ul>
                        <li>Business logic scattered across controllers and services</li>
                        <li>Inconsistent data models that don't reflect business reality</li>
                        <li>Difficulty implementing new business requirements</li>
                        <li>Code that's hard to test and maintain</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h2>Key Takeaways</h2>

                    <p>
                        Domain-driven design isn't just an architectural pattern – it's a way of thinking about 
                        software that puts business value first. For e-commerce platforms, this approach leads to:
                    </p>

                    <ul>
                        <li>More maintainable codebases that evolve with business needs</li>
                        <li>Better communication between developers and business stakeholders</li>
                        <li>Reduced technical debt and easier feature development</li>
                        <li>Systems that actually solve real business problems</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>
                        The next time you're building an e-commerce feature, start by understanding the business 
                        domain first. Your future self (and your team) will thank you.
