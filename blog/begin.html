                        Every journey has a starting point. This is mine.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        I've been building software professionally for several years now, but I've never 
                        taken the time to document the journey. The wins, the failures, the lessons learned 
                        along the way. This blog is my attempt to change that.
                    </p>

                    <h2>Why Now?</h2>
                    
                    <p>
                        There's something powerful about putting thoughts into words. It forces clarity. 
                        It creates accountability. And maybe, just maybe, it helps someone else who's 
                        walking a similar path.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        I've learned that the best developers aren't just good at writing code â€“ they're 
                        good at sharing knowledge, building communities, and helping others grow. This 
                        blog is my contribution to that tradition.
                    </p>

                    <h2>What to Expect</h2>

                    <p>
                        I plan to write about the things I'm learning and the problems I'm solving. 
                        That might include:
                    </p>

                    <ul>
                        <li>Technical deep-dives into e-commerce and web development</li>
                        <li>Lessons learned from working on large-scale applications</li>
                        <li>Thoughts on software architecture and design patterns</li>
                        <li>Career reflections and growth experiences</li>
                        <li>Tools and techniques that make development more enjoyable</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>
                        I'm not trying to be the smartest person in the room. I'm just trying to be 
                        honest about what I'm learning and how I'm growing.
                    </p>

                    <h2>The Journey Ahead</h2>

                    <p>
                        Currently, I'm working on improving checkout experiences at New Balance, diving 
                        deep into Salesforce Commerce Cloud and PWAKit. There's so much to learn about 
                        building scalable e-commerce solutions that perform well and delight users.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        I'm also passionate about domain-driven design and how it can help us build 
                        software that truly reflects the business problems we're solving. There's 
                        something beautiful about code that reads like the business domain it represents.
                    </p>

                    <h2>A Personal Note</h2>

                    <p>
                        Writing has never come naturally to me. I'm much more comfortable expressing 
                        ideas through code than through prose. But I believe that stepping outside 
                        our comfort zones is where growth happens.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        So here I am, beginning this journey of sharing what I learn. Some posts might 
                        be technical tutorials. Others might be personal reflections. All of them will 
                        be honest attempts to document the path of a developer who's still figuring 
                        things out.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        If you're reading this, thank you for joining me at the beginning. I hope 
                        something I share along the way proves useful to you.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Let's begin.
