                    <p>
                        Early in my career, I thought being a good developer meant writing clever code. 
                        Complex one-liners, obscure language features, and intricate abstractions felt like 
                        badges of honor. Then I had to maintain that code six months later, and I learned 
                        a hard lesson: clever code is often the enemy of good code.
                    </p>

                    <h2>The True Cost of Complexity</h2>
                    
                    <p>
                        Working on enterprise applications at Red Cedar and now at New Balance, I've seen 
                        how code complexity compounds over time. What seems like a small shortcut today 
                        becomes a major roadblock when you need to:
                    </p>

                    <ul>
                        <li>Add new features without breaking existing functionality</li>
                        <li>Debug issues under pressure during production incidents</li>
                        <li>Onboard new team members who need to understand the system</li>
                        <li>Refactor code to meet changing business requirements</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h2>Principles That Matter</h2>

                    <p>
                        Over the years, I've developed a set of principles that guide how I write code. 
                        These aren't revolutionary ideas, but they're the ones that have consistently 
                        made my code more maintainable:
                    </p>

                    <h3>1. Clarity Over Cleverness</h3>
                    <p>
                        If you have to think hard to understand what your code does, imagine how your 
                        teammates (or future you) will feel. Write code that tells a story.
                    </p>

                    <h3>2. Single Responsibility</h3>
                    <p>
                        Functions and classes should do one thing well. When you find yourself using 
                        "and" to describe what a function does, it's probably doing too much.
                    </p>

                    <h3>3. Meaningful Names</h3>
                    <p>
                        Variable and function names should explain intent, not just implementation. 
                        <code>calculateTotalWithTax()</code> is better than <code>calc()</code>.
                    </p>

                    <h3>4. Consistent Patterns</h3>
                    <p>
                        Establish conventions and stick to them. When similar problems are solved 
                        in similar ways, the codebase becomes predictable and easier to navigate.
                    </p>

                    <h2>Real-World Examples</h2>

                    <p>
                        At New Balance, we refactored our checkout flow to follow these principles. 
                        Instead of one massive function that handled everything from cart validation 
                        to payment processing, we broke it down into focused, testable components:
                    </p>

                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>CartValidator</strong> – ensures cart contents are valid</li>
                        <li><strong>PriceCalculator</strong> – handles pricing logic and discounts</li>
                        <li><strong>PaymentProcessor</strong> – manages payment transactions</li>
                        <li><strong>OrderCreator</strong> – creates and persists order records</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>
                        Each component has a clear responsibility, making the system easier to test, 
                        debug, and extend. When we needed to add new payment methods, we only had 
                        to modify the PaymentProcessor.
                    </p>

                    <h2>The Testing Connection</h2>

                    <p>
                        Clean code and testable code go hand in hand. When your functions are small, 
                        focused, and have clear inputs and outputs, writing tests becomes natural. 
                        And when you have good tests, refactoring becomes safe.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        I've found that if code is hard to test, it's usually a sign that it needs 
                        to be simplified or broken down further.
                    </p>

                    <h2>The Long Game</h2>

                    <p>
                        Writing clean code isn't about following rules for the sake of it – it's about 
                        building software that can evolve with changing requirements. In my experience, 
                        the projects that succeed long-term are the ones where:
                    </p>

                    <ul>
                        <li>New developers can contribute quickly</li>
                        <li>Bugs are easy to locate and fix</li>
                        <li>Features can be added without major rewrites</li>
                        <li>The codebase remains a joy to work with</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>
                        Clean code isn't just about the code itself – it's about the people who will 
                        work with it. When you write code that's easy to understand and modify, you're 
                        not just solving today's problems; you're making tomorrow's solutions possible.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        As I always say: code is like humor. When you have to explain it, it's bad.
