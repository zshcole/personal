                    <p>
                        Working on New Balance's e-commerce platform, I've learned that performance isn't just about 
                        fast load times – it's about creating experiences that feel instant and responsive. 
                        PWAKit gives us powerful tools for optimization, but knowing how to use them effectively 
                        makes all the difference.
                    </p>

                    <h2>The Performance Challenge</h2>
                    
                    <p>
                        E-commerce sites face unique performance challenges. Users expect product pages to load 
                        instantly, search results to appear as they type, and checkout flows to be seamless. 
                        With PWAKit, we're building React applications that need to perform well on everything 
                        from high-end desktops to budget mobile devices.
                    </p>

                    <h2>Bundle Size Optimization</h2>

                    <p>
                        The first rule of PWAKit performance: ship less JavaScript. Here are the techniques 
                        that have worked best for us:
                    </p>

                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Code splitting</strong> – Load only what users need, when they need it</li>
                        <li><strong>Tree shaking</strong> – Remove unused code from third-party libraries</li>
                        <li><strong>Dynamic imports</strong> – Lazy load heavy components and utilities</li>
                        <li><strong>Bundle analysis</strong> – Regular audits to catch size regressions</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>
                        We reduced our initial bundle size by 40% just by implementing proper code splitting 
                        for our product detail pages. The checkout flow, which most users never see, is now 
                        loaded only when needed.
                    </p>

                    <h2>Caching Strategies</h2>

                    <p>
                        PWAKit's built-in caching is powerful, but it needs to be configured thoughtfully:
                    </p>

                    <ol>
                        <li><strong>Static assets</strong> – Long-term caching with content hashing</li>
                        <li><strong>API responses</strong> – Smart invalidation based on data freshness needs</li>
                        <li><strong>Page-level caching</strong> – Different strategies for different page types</li>
                        <li><strong>Service worker optimization</strong> – Efficient background sync and updates</li>
                    </ol>

                    <h2>Core Web Vitals</h2>

                    <p>
                        Google's Core Web Vitals aren't just SEO metrics – they correlate directly with 
                        conversion rates. Here's how we improved ours:
                    </p>

                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Largest Contentful Paint (LCP)</strong> – Optimized image loading and critical CSS</li>
                        <li><strong>First Input Delay (FID)</strong> – Reduced main thread blocking with better code splitting</li>
                        <li><strong>Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS)</strong> – Reserved space for dynamic content</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h2>Real-World Results</h2>

                    <p>
                        After implementing these optimizations, we saw:
                    </p>

                    <ul>
                        <li>30% reduction in page load times</li>
                        <li>25% improvement in mobile performance scores</li>
                        <li>15% increase in conversion rates on mobile devices</li>
                        <li>Significantly better user experience metrics</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h2>Tools and Monitoring</h2>

                    <p>
                        Performance optimization is an ongoing process. We use:
                    </p>

                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Lighthouse CI</strong> – Automated performance testing in our build pipeline</li>
                        <li><strong>Real User Monitoring</strong> – Understanding actual user experiences</li>
                        <li><strong>Bundle analyzers</strong> – Regular audits of our JavaScript bundles</li>
                        <li><strong>Performance budgets</strong> – Preventing regressions before they ship</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>
                        The key is making performance a priority from the start, not something you optimize 
                        after the fact. With PWAKit's tools and the right approach, you can build e-commerce 
                        experiences that are both feature-rich and lightning-fast.
