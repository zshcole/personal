            <p>
                when our team was tasked with improving site performance, we faced a complex 
                e-commerce platform with millions of monthly visitors. here's how we approached 
                the challenge and achieved a 30% reduction in load times.
            </p>
            
            <h2>code splitting and lazy loading</h2>
            <p>
                our first major win came from implementing aggressive code splitting. by breaking 
                our application into smaller chunks and only loading what's needed for the current 
                view, we reduced initial JavaScript payload by over 60%.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                for routes that weren't part of the critical user journey, we implemented lazy loading:
            </p>
            
            <pre><code>
            // Before
            import HeavyComponent from './HeavyComponent';

            // After
            const HeavyComponent = React.lazy(() => import('./HeavyComponent'));

            function MyComponent() {
            return (
                &lt;React.Suspense fallback={&lt;Spinner /&gt;}&gt;
                &lt;HeavyComponent /&gt;
                &lt;/React.Suspense&gt;
            );
            }
            </code></pre>
            
            <h2>strategic caching</h2>
            <p>
                we implemented a multi-layered caching strategy:
            </p>
            
            <ul>
                <li>http caching with appropriate cache-control headers</li>
                <li>service worker caching for offline capabilities</li>
                <li>application-level caching for expensive api calls</li>
                <li>cdn caching for static assets with long ttls</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p>
                this approach not only improved performance but also reduced server load and 
                bandwidth costs significantly.
            </p>
