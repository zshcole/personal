                the e-commerce landscape is rapidly evolving, with headless architecture emerging as 
                the clear path forward for businesses looking to stay competitive in an increasingly 
                complex digital marketplace.

            <h2>what is headless commerce?</h2>
            <p>
                at its core, headless commerce separates the frontend presentation layer from the 
                backend commerce functionality. this decoupling allows teams to work independently, 
                iterate quickly, and deliver optimized experiences across multiple touchpoints.

                working with <strong>salesforce commerce cloud</strong> has shown me firsthand how 
                this approach enables brands to:
            </p>
            
            <ul>
                <li>deploy new frontend experiences without disrupting backend operations</li>
                <li>optimize for mobile, voice, and emerging channels simultaneously</li>
                <li>integrate with best-of-breed services rather than all-in-one solutions</li>
            </ul>
